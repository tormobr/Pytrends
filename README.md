# Pytrends
Initally a repo for exploring google trends, however it evolved

## About
This is simply a flask app with some useless howevery interesting(maybe) information. Run it with:
```
python server.py
```
After this it should be running on `locahost:5000` the app should also be deployed at `brandyberry.pythonanywhere.com`, so head over and check it out.

The implementation (especially the javascript)  is messy as hell
